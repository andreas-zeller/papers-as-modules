# Software Papers as Software Modules

**Towards a Culture of Reusable Results**

**Abstract.** _The future of scientific papers lies in the tight integration of traditional text with program code that can reproduce results on demand.  In this essay, I demonstrate that this integration also enables new reuse mechanisms: In the future, we could import and extend code from other papers just as we cite and extend their ideas._
